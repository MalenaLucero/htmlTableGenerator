# HTML Table Generator

Github Pages link: https://malenalucero.github.io/htmlTableGenerator/

This application creates an HTML table with the items copied from a Word file table. It gets the items through a <textarea> input and creates an array of strings. The array elements are then pushed to an HTML table generated by the number of rows and columns the user inputs. If no rows and columns are specified, the default values are rows=6 and columns=2.
